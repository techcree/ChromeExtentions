Chrome extensions are useful helpers to increase productivity when working with the browser or to simplify certain steps. You can use the example extensions contained here freely and free of charge!

You need to create a folder for Extention Images called /img
I used some images called: GSkanta.png, GSkanta16.png, GSkanta32.png, GSkanta48.png and GSkanta128.png with diffrent Size of Pixels. These Images will shown as the Extention Icons.
You need also to create a folder for Google Application Icons calles /gimg
I Used CalT.png, ChatT.png, CSerarchT.png, DocsT.png, DriveT.png and so further. If you create and use these images you may need to use images with transparent backgroung if you later like to change the extentions background color.
You can change the Image Informations for the application icons in the start.html file. For changing the extentions icons you need to fix the manifest.json file like you need.
